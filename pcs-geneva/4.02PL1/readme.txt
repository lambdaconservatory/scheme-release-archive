Dear Schemers,

The new release 4.02PL1 of PC-Scheme/Geneva is now available.

Here are a few points:

- PCS/Geneva is a free product developed by a team at the u. of Geneva.
  It is based upon, but differs somewhat from, Texas Instrument's PCS 3.03.
  The enhancements include:
       * 80486 support & overall cleaning of the system
       * a powerful graphics interface (Borland's BGI)
       * mouse support (including for Scheme-written interrupt routines)
       * several powerful Scheme-oriented editors

- There is a general address for PCS/Geneva: 'schemege@cui.unige.ch'.
  We accept any message -- flames, congratulations, etc. -- and try to
  respond quickly. The developers can individually be reached as 
  'lbartho@cui.unige.ch' and 'mvuilleu@cui.unige.ch'.

- PC-Scheme/Geneva is available on anonymous ftp site cui.unige.ch, 
  in subdir /pub/pcs, as self-extract archives and gzipped-tar TAZ format.

- The PCSCHEME archive contains the executable files, precompiled libraries 
  and TeX/PostScript documentation on extensions, as well as an exhaustive
  reference card. The archive's size is around 800kb, including 
  documentation.

- The SOURCES archive contains the source files, for use with Borland C++
  programming tools. PCS/Geneva is written in C, C++, Assembler and Scheme.
  This archive's size is about 800kb too.

- PCS/Geneva 4.02PL1 has been tested on a wide variety of machines, including
  palmtops such as HP's HP95lx, Sun's with a DOS emulator, DOS compatibility
  boxes within OS/2, DOS windows within Microsoft Windows, and old 8086 PCs.


                                                Larry & Marc
